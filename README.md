This is the repository for the code in my series of posts on <a href="https://www.jaylagare.com/2024/11/introduction-to-artificial-neural-networks/" target="_blank">artificial neural networks</a>.<br><br>

mnist_samples - folder containing samples from the MNIST dataset<br>
real_world_samples - folder containing samples from the real world, i.e. my handwriting<br>
create_basic_model.py - create a basic ANN based on 3Blue1Brown's introduction to artificial neural networks series of videos<br>
extract_mnist_samples.py - extract random sample from test data of the MNIST dataset<br>
recognize.py - recognize numbers from images using the model we created<br>
preprocess.py - image preprocessing to match MNIST dataset characteristics in preparation for recognition<br>
create_advanced_model.py - create a more advanced ANN based on TensorFlow recommendation
